  scenario_text: 'To the northern corridor you go, with nothing in hand to protect
    yourself. In the darkness you spot a massive creature, shrieking horribly. The
    creature looks like an amalgamation of tentacles: a Chaos Spawn, a creature corrupted
    by the Great Enemy of Mankind!


    Even if your heart burns with rage at the sight of the monster, you know well
    that you will require a weapon to fight it. As you try to reach for your Lasgun,
    you realize it''s not there! You will need to find a weapon...'

  scenario_alt_text: "To the northern corridor you go, ready for a fight with whoever
    or whatever is making this terrible noise. In the darkness you spot a massive
    creature that, with a horrid screech, jumps to your location.\n\nYou fight the
    creature, Lasgun in hand. With a few solid shots, it crawls on the ground un-moving.
    However, your head feels ever heavier and your sight grows dimmer. The creature...
    awakened something in you. You feel a manifestation of the Warp take a hold of
    your mind.\r You can no longer think straight. Your thoughts are being corrupted
    by the very creature you killed.\r Your devotion to the God Emperor turns to hatred.\r
    Your faith in His will becomes deceitful schemeing and lies.\r Your outlook for
    the Imperium's survival become bleak, and you find humour in that.\r Your desire
    for pleasures once denied to you can no longer be sated.\r\n\nIn your last concious
    moments, you feel you are about to transform nto the very creature you have just
    slain."
