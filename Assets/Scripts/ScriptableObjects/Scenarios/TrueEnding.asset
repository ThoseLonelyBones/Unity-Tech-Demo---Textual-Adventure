  scenario_text: "You realize you no longer have a body. You are witnessing yourself,
    wake up from a long slumber and take once again the steps you decided to make,
    turning into the creature an infinite amount of times.\n\r\nYou realize this reality
    you are in is nothing more than a game and you are but a pawn.\r The Architect
    of Fate delights in your limited choices and cackles at the thought of you attempting
    to break the cycle. There is no salvation, only Tzeentch's Plan.\r\n\r\r\nYou
    scream, but realize that you no longer have any presence here. Your body is not
    here and these words are but a representations of your thoughts. Your soul is
    in the Warp. The God-Emperor failed you.\r\n\r\nOne last time, before your soul
    is forced to be reborn again, you hear the God of Deceit's maddening laughter."
