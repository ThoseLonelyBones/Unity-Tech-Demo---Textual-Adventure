    shaft. The insides are filthy, and a greenish muck seems to cover every inch and
    wall of this place.\r\n\nAs you put your hand close to the substance, it singes
    your skin. This acid is very potent and will melt you in seconds if you go in
    like that. You realize that if you are to cross around this place, you will need
    protective gear which you don't have. Maybe there's some left about...\n\n\n"

    to slide around the place without getting corroded.\r\n\r\nThe blinking light
    is revealed to be a working Lasgun! You thank the Emperor for this humble gift:
    the Lasgun is the one, true weapon of the Guard and it will serve you well against
    the coming horrors.\n\nYou have aquired the Lasgun!"
