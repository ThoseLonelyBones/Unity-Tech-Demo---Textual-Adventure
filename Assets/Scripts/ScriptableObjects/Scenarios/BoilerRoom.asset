  scenario_text: "Pushing through the heat of the boiler room, you find yourself in
    what appears to be the aftermath of a battle.\r\n\r\nFellow Guardsmen are lying
    motionless on the ground, their armor and weapons broken and battered by what
    appears to be a gigantic creature's swings.\n\nFortunately, one of them still
    has some armor in servicable condition, the only piece of equipment worth taking.
    You are not a stranger to repurposing the dead's items and the armor fits you
    well enough.\n\nYou have aquired Acidproof Armor!"

  scenario_alt_text: "You return in the boiler room, attempting to locate a new path
    or some extra scavengable items. However, nothing else seems to catch your attention
    in the room. \n\nYou take a moment to do a quick prayer: \"May these poor souls
    find comfort knowing they died serving the God-Emperor\"."
