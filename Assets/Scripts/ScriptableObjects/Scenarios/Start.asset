  scenario_text: "The year is the 999th of the 41st Millenium. Your planet is Cadia
    and, like countless others, you are part of the Imperial Guard: Mankind's thousands
    of billions of faithful servants who fight and give their life to protect the
    Imperium's continued existence in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nYou were fighting hordes
    of unidentified creatures out of your worst nightmares when you blacked out. You
    don't remember much but your head feels heavy and your sight grows ever dimmer.\r\n\r\nThe
    only thing you can scan around you is the bleak and depressing corridors of the
    Hive City and - labirinthic as they are - give you no direction on your current
    location.\r\n\r\nWhat do you want to do?"
